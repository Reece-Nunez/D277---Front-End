# front-end-web-development

This project is a comprehensive task set by Western Governors University for the Front-End Web Development course, where I will apply my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create a multipage website. The site will represent a state within the United States and will include a main introduction page, along with additional pages for the capital and two other cities, detailing specific information such as population, income levels, and city classification. I will design a consistent navigation scheme and ensure the site is user-centered with reactive interfaces. The website must incorporate various web elements like tables, lists, and forms, and include both absolute and relative positioning, along with a hover effect for navigation using CSS.
